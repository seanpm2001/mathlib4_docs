There are several\nequivalent characterizations of this definition. For the definition, we pick one that avoids\nuniverse issues: a set is analytic if and only if it is a continuous image of `ℕ → ℕ` (or if it\nis empty). The above more usual characterization is given\nin `analyticSet_iff_exists_polishSpace_range`.\n\nWarning: these are analytic sets in the context of descriptive set theory (which is why they are\nregistered in the namespace `MeasureTheory`). They have nothing to do with analytic sets in the\ncontext of complex analysis. "}]}
