Note that this is a conditionally rather than absolutely convergent\nseries. The main tool that this proof uses is the Mean Value Theorem (specifically avoiding the\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus).\n\nIntuitively, the theorem holds because Leibniz's series is the Taylor series of `arctan x`\ncentered about `0` and evaluated at the value `x = 1`. Therefore, much of this proof consists of\nreasoning about a function\n  `f := arctan x - ∑ i in Finset.range k, (-(1:ℝ))^i * x^(2*i+1) / (2*i+1)`,\nthe difference between `arctan` and the `k`-th partial sum of its Taylor series. Some ingenuity is\nrequired due to the fact that the Taylor series is not absolutely convergent at `x = 1`.\n\nThis proof requires a bound on `f 1`, the key idea being that `f 1` can be split as the sum of\n`f 1 - f u` and `f u`, where `u` is a sequence of values in [0,1], carefully chosen such that\neach of these two terms can be controlled (in different ways).\n\nWe begin the proof by (1) introducing that sequence `u` and then proving that another sequence\nconstructed from `u` tends to `0` at `+∞`. After (2) converting the limit in our goal to an\ninequality, we (3) introduce the auxiliary function `f` defined above. Next, we (4) compute the\nderivative of `f`, denoted by `f'`, first generally and then on each of two subintervals of [0,1].\nWe then (5) prove a bound for `f'`, again both generally as well as on each of the two\nsubintervals. Finally, we (6) apply the Mean Value Theorem twice, obtaining bounds on `f 1 - f u`\nand `f u - f 0` from the bounds on `f'` (note that `f 0 = 0`). "}]}
